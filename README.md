This bot automates participant verification via Telegram. Only authorized admins can manage the data collection process.

**Features**:
- Automatically sends instructions to users via private chat.
- Forwards submissions to group/channel.
- Admins can reply in group, and the bot forwards replies back to the user.
- Quick buttons for "Complete" / "Incomplete" status.
- Restricts verification control to registered admin IDs.

**How It Works**??
1. Participants send data to the bot via private message.
2. The bot forwards it to the admin-only channel.
3. Admin replies or clicks status buttons.
4. Bot sends the response back to the participant.
